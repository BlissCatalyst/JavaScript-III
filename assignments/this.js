/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. In Window Binding, "this" refers to the actual browser window.
* 2. For Implicit Binding, "this" refers to whatever is left of the dot when the object is being called or invoked.
* 3. In New Binding, "this" refers to the new object being made by invoking the constructor object and passing it the key/value pairs as arguments.
* 4. For Explicit Bindind, "this" will only refer to both the object and function (if the function is taken out of the object) when you invoke the function with a method such as .call().apply().bind and passing the object and function in as parameters.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
